# OOP_SciFi_Interface_Assignment_2016
This is my ScFi Interface for the OOP assignemnt.

### Features of my assignment ##

- my front screen displays text "terminator" and 2 circles increasing, this gives a sci fi effect. 
- I then have 1 rectangle coming from the top and 1 rectangle coming from the bottom to highlight the fact the user has to click
- when the user clicks, the next screen is shown.

- I am most proud of the fact that a warning message is shown untill the user charges the terminators battery
- There is a radar to give the effect the terminator is scanning for the target 
- The user cannot view the targets profile untill the battery is charged.
- The user can then view the targets profile and the terminators voice is heard. This gives the effect the terminator will asssassinate his target.
